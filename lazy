# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# you can remove the 'exit 1' above and add more functionality.  For instance,
# gitpod supplies the reponame (without the trailing '.git') as an argument to
# this script.  You can make use of it somehow.

# patches welcome.  Please keep things backward compat.

# rc file has 'lazy = repo'
repo="$1"
    # NOTE: this comes in WITHOUT the '.git' at the end.  The rc file is
    # expected to have reponames the same way.

# now do stuff with $rc and $repo and decide...
